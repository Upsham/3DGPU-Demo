3DGPU Demo Code
==========

This repository contains the captured data and demo for the 3D Graphics Processing Unit made for ECE337 at Purdue. It was retroactively added, but was actually completed in Fall 2010. This demo assumes that you have Java version 1.6 or up installed on your machine. Please clone this repo (or download directly) and run the following command from your terminal in the downloaded directory:

```
  $ java FrameDrawer mem_dump.txt 71
```

If you need to recompile, run the usual javac command first:

```
  $ javac *.java
```
